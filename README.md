# Unofficial Apple DEP Status Page.

This is an unofficial Apple DEP status page, maintained by the macadmins (you!).
This is forked from the [original](https://github.com/macadmins/isdepdownorjustme), as the original domain registration had expired.

# How to update the status page.

Simply send a [Pull Request](https://github.com/macadmins/isdepdownorjustme/pulls) with the changes to the `depstatus.md` file (in the _includes folder) with the following:

`Up :smile:`

or

`Down :rage:`


Github will handle the rest.
